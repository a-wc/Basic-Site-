            <p>Rugby was played in Thornbury back in Victorian times but the club struggled to survive and eventually folded
                in the late nineteenth century. Thornbury Rugby Club as it is today was founded in 1963 by a handful of rugby
                enthusiasts working on major engineering projects in the north Bristol area. With no obvious local club to play
                for the original members, which included the father of future England international Simon Hodgkinson, decided to
                form their own and after advertising for players in the local newspaper played their first games in September 1963.

                The first home game was a 9-9 draw with Whitehall played on the Mundy Playing Fields. The club continued to play there until in 1965 when they secured a loan
                to buy land at Cooper Farm on the northern outskirts of the town. It has remained the very happy home of the club ever since. The major construction works 
                also brought in former Wales international Gareth Payne into the neighbourhood and he played in the second row during the 1964/65 season. In the early years 
                of the club the playing side was built around the mercurial John Broad, the former Bristol and Gloucestershire player who was an enormous influence off and on 
                the rugby field.
